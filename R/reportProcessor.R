#' Common report processor for NorSpis
#'
#' Makes reports for NorSpis typically used for auto reports such as
#' subscriptions, dispatchments and bulletins. As such, please be warned that
#' any changes to this function might render existing auto reports nonfunctional
#' as they are based on static calls based on any previous version of this
#' function. Changes should therefore be thoroughly tested against existing auto
#' reports. Altering the names of the arguments will likely be a breaking
#' change. Adding new arguments should be safe as long as they are provided a
#' default value.
